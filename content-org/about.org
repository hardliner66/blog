About Me
#+end_description

Hi. My name is Steve, but online I'm more commonly known as [[https://github.com/hardliner66][*hardliner66*]], IAmHardliner or just hardliner for short. This is my first blog,
which I want to use to record some of the things floating around in my brain for others to see.

I'm 33 years old and spent the last 18 years learning about software engineering, architecture and programming languages. In this time I learned more than
25 programming languages.

My current main language is Rust and I'm currently trying to learn lisp.
