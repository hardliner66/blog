If you're wondering why there was no activity on the blog, let me tell you a bit on the last few months.


## Why I didn't write {#why-i-didnt-write}

There are plenty of reasons I stopped blogging shortly after, but some of them are quite private.
The ones I can and want to talk about are basically about work and motivation.

For quite some while I was struggling with motivation, where I couldn't get myself to do anything productive outside of work.
No programming, no cool projects, no learning, no blog. But in recent weeks I got some of my drive back and I started working
on a [cool project](https://github.com/organix/uFork), with really cool people ([who also blog (sometimes)](http://www.dalnefre.com/wp/)).

## The near future {#the-near-future}

Hopefully this keeps up and I can finally start to put my thoughts into text. There's a few topics I wanna write about including:
- The Actor Model
- Programming Language Design
- Hardware Design & FPGAs
- Software Architecture

And a few more.

## What's next {#whats-next}

Probably something about actors. A friend of mine keeps nagging me about it, because I always praise it so highly,
so I think that's a good next topic.

So, I'll hopefully be back with some real content soon.
